                        <p><i>Noise Complaint</i> is an action/puzzle game where you aim to destroy your neighbor's party so you can get some sleep. To do so, you must complete a 
                        series of tasks that will encourage the partygoers to leave, reducing the overall noise level. It's not that simple, though, as some of the partygoers will 
                        not be too happy about your actions and attempt to fight you, and your actions have also prompted people to call the police, so your time is limited. Depending
                        on how many of the tasks you complete, you'll be given a "score" based on how many hours of rest you get.</p>

                        <p>
                            For this game, I worked on design, programming, and sound. <br>
                            This game was produced by a team of four, so the task of design was shared pretty equally among the four of us. I came up with the original concept, and as a 
                            team we finalized the concept, as well as coming up with the tasks and whatnot. The game was produced for a game jam, so no playtesting was involved.<br>
                            For programming, I wrote a number of scripts for the game, as well as implementing the functionality of every sound. In particular, I was responsible for the player
                            movement, camera controls, throwable object behavior, grab functionality, and some of the objectives. <br>
                            Out of the games I've done sound for, this is probably my favorite. While I didn't create the music, I created the muffled version for when you're not in the house, 
                            and I thought it came out pretty well. I quite like all of the sound effects for this game as well, and I even lent my voice to the Game Awards-worthy performance
                            of the Dad in the phone call task. 
                        </p> 
                        <h4 class="title">Production and Challenges</h4>
                        <p>
                            This game was completed as part of a game jam for Northeastern's Rapid Idea Prototyping course, for which we were given a week. The theme of the jam was "Silence," 
                            and our group chose to interpret that as wanting to silence your noisy neighbors, which was very much me projecting my frustration at the thin walls in my apartment. 
                            Of course, this game jam was done as our midterm for the class, meaning it coincided with our midterms for other classes, meaning time management was our biggest hurdle. 
                            The game was very well scoped, as we got in all the functionality we wanted before the deadline.
